							    									  				<h2> Nr 1 Growing rocks/klipps </h2>
					<p>Sweden is a nice country as a travel destination, but in northern Sweden there are stones and rocks growing from the ground into houses and buildings, it sounds strange but it has happened for real. In November 2022, SVT-Nyheter reported that a large rock in Norrbotten has grown out of the ground into a house. The husband Eric Svensson has said that "The day before the incident, nothing has indicated that such a horrible thing would happen". It's not pouring the first time this happened. In Sweden, there have been several deaths.</p> 
					 
					 
					 <h2> Nr 2. Strange creatures in the forests </h2> 
				    <p> In Sweden, more than 100 people a year disappear in the dark forests without them having returned, or been found. "One day I was walking in the woods, it was a Sunday evening in the middle of autumn and when I walked a little further into the woods I heard strange voices. I thought it was an animal, but it didn't sound like an animal, but it doesn't pour like a human. The Jew licked stone's throw and as if someone were walking on branches. I looked behind me and saw something human-like, but you could  only see black long hair, along the whole body. I was completely devastated, I ran away" Reported Bj√∂rn Johansson. </p>
					<h2> Nr 3.  Poisonous Swedich Foods </h2>	
                    <p> Sweden is known for its delicious traditional dishes, but recently a research from the University of Gothenburg has shown that it has become toxic to eat Swedish vegetables and much more. The news plattform "Svenska dagbladet" reports that harmful substances have been found in Swedish vegetables. David Anders Johansson reports that "These substances used in our food are, among other things, the E78-V chemical to make our food more sustainable, but it damages the heart and blood vessel system, but also causes cancer. E233-C is an agent that causes cancer but is used as a preservative" </p> 																					
				      
					  <h2> Nr 4 Drug consumeration </h2>
					<p> Over 23% of Sweden's population consumes drugs of all types. The most consumed drugs are Mariuana, Cocaine Blow, C, candy, coke, do a line, freeze, girl, happy dust, Mama coca, mojo, monster, nose, pimp, shot and smoking gun. Consumer consumption increased by 4% compared to 2021. Police report at least 30 suspected drug abuse and overconsumerization in the city of Stockholm. In Sweden, therefore, violence is not uncommon either. </p> 
					  
					  <h2> Nr 5. Corruption  </h2> 
					<p> In Sweden, corruption is not uncommon either. Taxes are being raised and the parties are not sticking to what they promise to society. Pensioners Anton Thoma and Lucas Svensson say that "We have worked for over 30 years and we are not getting the pension we need. The only thing we can afford is to buy water and bread. We can't even afford to buy ourselves new clothes. We live in Herrljunga and the municipality promised that we would have our pensions increased! But when we then asked again, they said that it is not possible to give out the money because we have to invest in something else." </p> 														      
			         
					 <h2> Nr 6. Unpleasant people </h2> 
                    <p> In Sweden over 20% of the population is rude to its tourists and visitors. A study from the Swedish government has shown that at least 14% of the population do not feel well mentally and that at least 8% are overstressed. Magnus Karlsson says that "In Sweden since the 1970s, the people have become unpleasant. Ordinary people are out on the streets fighting. If you call the police, it is not certain that they will come. In 2022 until now, insecurity has increased significantly in the country". Lukas Ottosson, head of the Swedish Parliament, has in 2022 made a decision to create a new security package, but it did not help anything. In the southern part of Sweden it is safer than in the north. </p>
					  
					  <h2> Nr 7. Wierd car rules </h2>
				    <p> In Sweden, it is not uncommon for drivers to have to forcibly scrap their own cars to replace it with an electric car, even for tourists. Those who dare to protest go to jail. Reporter Krister Hansson reports that " In Sweden, there has always been injustice. Since I had to scrap my car, I have high electricity bills because of the recharges and received no compensation at all. Because so many people consume drugs, there is a lot of unemployment, which affects my family." A study in Stockholm shows that unemployment increased by 5 percent compared to 2021 and many families do have problems with the payment of electric bills since it is required to replace the car. </p> 
                      <h2> Nr 8. Expensiveness </h2> 
					<p> In Sweden, everything is expensive, before the war in Ukraine and now. The bread costs about 100 SEK per bread. 500g cheese costs almost 120 SEK and there is almost no meat, and no sausages pour. The Swedish government promised to lower the price, but instead the prices were raised. </p> 
                      <h2> Nr 9. Criminal regime </h2> 
					<p>
